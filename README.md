Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project involved designing a comprehensive system for DriverPass, the client, to enhance driver training. They wanted a system that provides students with online practice tests and on-the-road training to better prepare for DMV driving tests. The system needed to offer online classes, practice tests, and scheduling capabilities for driving lessons, accessible from any device.


What did you do particularly well?

I did well in defining the system's objectives and requirements. The business requirements document clearly captured the client's needs, providing a solid foundation for the system design. My use of diagrams, like use case, activity, sequence, and class diagrams, offered clear visual representations of system interactions and structure.


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could revise one part of my work, it would be the diagrams. I would include more detailed steps in the activity diagrams, such as incorporating login processes and additional user interactions. Additionally, I would extend the class diagram to cover more aspects of the DriverPass system, ensuring a comprehensive representation of all components and their relationships. This would provide a clearer and more complete visualization of the system's functionality and structure.


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user's needs by closely analyzing the interview transcript and aligning the system's features with those needs. This involved understanding the client's goals and translating them into specific functionalities. Considering user needs is crucial to ensure the system is user-friendly and meets the intended purpose, ultimately leading to higher user satisfaction and effectiveness.


How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

My approach to designing software involves thorough requirement gathering and iterative design. I focus on creating a clear and detailed plan before development begins. In the future, I would use more prototyping techniques and user feedback sessions to refine the design. This iterative approach allows for adjustments based on real user interactions and needs.
